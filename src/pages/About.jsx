      <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
        Vijay’s Testimonials Site is a platform built to help users
        store, manage, and showcase their reviews from different platforms
        like Google, Swiggy, Zomato, and more — all in one secure place.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
        Instead of losing valuable feedback across multiple apps,
        our platform allows you to centralize your testimonials and
        access them anytime, anywhere.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "16px" }}>
        This project is built using the MERN stack with a focus on
        simplicity, security, and a clean user experience.
